iComm

This is a modified program of my block diagram editor that I was making for a circuit simulator.  
I realized that I could apply this to my job and am now making a satellite simulator tailored 
towards payload budgets, radiation susceptibility/emission, non-conformance report tracker, live 
satellite status viewer, SSI trender.

Todo (Soon):
make snap to grid
draw elements 
tweak ui
make re/rs plugin
start making documentation using Sphinx

Todo (Later):
convert to PySide, this is almost transparent to PyQt and is more pythonic.
rebuild save load feature.  It's too complicated right now and if anything is added to the save
list, too many place need to be updated.
